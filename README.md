This is a small project I created in my freshmen year of high school, it was made for testing out html, css, js and some react and typescript.
- It is unfinished and won't be finished as I have no interest in pursuing this website.
- Originally made for unblocking your macbook
- It featured a script to remove restrictions (written by me) as well as some html games
